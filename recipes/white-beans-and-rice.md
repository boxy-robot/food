White Beans 'n Rice
====
This is my bastardization of red beans and rice mixed with cassoulet. There's more vegetables and I find white beans easier to digest, so it's a little healthier but still packs that smoky sausage flavor.


Ingredients
----
* 2 cans cannelini beans
* 1qt chicken stock
* 1.5lb beef sausage
* 1 yellow onion
* 3 carrots
* 2 stalks of celery
* 1/2 head garlic
* 4 sprigs of thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 2c white rice
* Lousiana hot sauce

Prep
----
* Cube carrots. Dice onion and celery. Mince garlic and thyme.
* Cut sausage into coins


Directions
----
* In a pot, brown sausage over medium heat, getting a good sear while being careful not to burn it. Remove to a bowl.
* Sautee veggies, starting with carrots, then celery, onions, and garlic.
* Add sausage back, stock, white beans, thyme, and bay leaves.
* Bring to simmer and cook for 45m, stirring occasionally.
* 15m before done, cook rice in a rice cooker.
* Serve beans over rice with hot sauce.
