# White Beans 'n Rice

This is my bastardization of red beans and rice mixed with cassoulet. There's more vegetables, and I find white beans easier to digest, so it's a little healthier but still packs that smoky sausage flavor.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans cannellini beans
- 1 qt chicken stock
- 1.5 lb beef sausage
- 1 yellow onion
- 3 carrots
- 2 stalks celery
- 1/2 head garlic
- 4 sprigs thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 cups white rice
- Louisiana hot sauce

## Prep

- Cube carrots. Dice onion and celery. Mince garlic and thyme.
- Cut sausage into coins.

## Directions

1. In a pot, brown sausage over medium heat, getting a good sear while being careful not to burn it. Remove to a bowl.
2. Saut√© veggies, starting with carrots, then celery, onions, and garlic.
3. Add sausage back, stock, white beans, thyme, and bay leaves.
4. Bring to simmer and cook for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. 15 minutes before done, cook rice in a rice cooker.
6. Serve beans over rice with hot sauce.
