# Sourdough

I like to let my sourdough rest longer before baking to make it actually sour. The tanginess pairs really well with butter and savory dishes. Using a little whole wheat flour makes the dough less sticky and much easier to work with. Adding olive oil makes the bread more moist and improves the texture.

## Tools

* Food scale
* Cast iron dutch oven

## Ingredients

* 150g sourdough starter
* 400g bread flour (King Arthur, blue)
* 80g whole wheat flour (King Arthur, orange)
* 350g warm water
* 20g kosher salt
* 10g olive oil

## Directions

The night before:

1. Do a maintenance feed and allow starter to rest on the counter at room temp over night.

Folding morning:

1. Do a bulk feed using 200g of bread flour and 120g water.
2. Let rest in a sunny spot for at least 4 hours.

Folding afternoon:

This is the part where it's more art. You may need to add small amounts of flour or water each time you fold the dough. You want the dough to have enough flour to hold its shape but not be too dry that it doesn't stick to itself. As you form the dough in the bowl, most of the dough in the bowl should be sticking to the the ball and pulling off the bowl. That's how you know you have the right consistency. Some dough/flour will be stuck to the sides, that's ok. Generally you want the dough to be a little wetter at the beginning, and then as the ball forms, add flour each fold to stiffen it up and hold it's shape better.

1. Save and store 1 cup of starter.
2. Weigh 350g warm water into a medium bowl.
3. Mix 150g of starter.
4. Add salt and olive oil.
5. Mix in flour using your hands wetting as much flour as you can to form a rough ball. Wait 15m.
6. Fold the dough by stretching it, and then folding one end back to the center. Rotate 90째 and repeat until you've done 4 sides. Then using your palm, pull the back of the ball down and towards you and to the right, spinning the ball against the sides of the bowl forming it into a tighter ball, making the surface on top smoother and taut. Wait 15m.
7. Repeat the folding process. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp towel. Wait 90m.
8. Repeat the folding process again. Cover and wait another 90m.
9. Repeat the folding process one final time. Dust the dough and bowl with flour. Place the dough in the bowl, cover, and let sit for 30m to allow it to start rising and form to the bowl.
10. Place in the fridge for 24-48h. The longer you let it proof, the tangier it gets, but also the harder it becomes to handle.

Baking day:

1. Remove the dough from the fridge and allow to warm up and rise slightly.
2. Place covered dutch oven in oven and heat to 500째. Allow the dutch oven to get nice and hot.
3. Quickly and carefully flip the dough onto the counter and then place into the dutch oven. The top of the bowl will be the bottom of the loaf, and the bowl shape will become the top of the loaf. Using a sharp knife or razer, cut a 1/2 inch cut down the middle of the loaf at a 45째 angle. This allows the bread to expand up as it rises without cracking your crust with big fissures.
4. Spritz with a healthy dose of water, cover, and place in oven for 20m.
5. After 20m, reduce temp to 450째 and bake for another 25-30m.

# Maintenance

Sourdough starter is a live culture and needs to be fed. Keep it in the fridge and feed once a week when not using. If kept at room temp, feed daily. It's best to let it rest in a warm sunny spot to become more active. I like to store my starter in a wide mouth mason jar with the lid loosely screwed on. Make sure your container has enough room for the starter to double its size.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup sourdough starter
* 50g bread flour
* 30g warm water

## Directions

1. Weigh 30g of water into a bowl.
2. Add 1c of starter to the water. Discard the rest. Mix into water.
3. Add flour.
4. Pour into a breatheable container and let rest in a sunnny spot for at least an hour.
5. Store in the fridge if not using immediately.
